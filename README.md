# The rise of the Ediacaran biota triggered by phosphorus from alkali basalts
MATLAB codes and dataset

# Overview
Here we perform a new compilation of P concentrations in global-scale volcanic rocks spanning the past 3.5 billion years (Gyr). The geochemical data have been downloaded from the EarthChem database. The average P concentrations in worldwide basaltic rocks (in the gridded dataset) from 3.5 Gyr ago to the present were calculated using the Bootstrap method in MATLAB. 

BS_grid.m - Calculating the average phosphorus concentrations in worldwide basaltic rocks from 3.5 to 0 Ga. 

# System Requirements
The codes used in this paper were compiled on the MATLAB (version R2014a). The operating system is Windows 7. The Mac system on an Apple computer with the MATLAB installed appropriately may also work. To run the program, the codes should be opened by the MATLAB (R2014a or higher version) and run by pressing the F5 on the keyboard. The datasets (in the form of Microsoft Excel spreadsheet) should be stored in the same directory as the codes. 
The codes were designated for this study and do not have a version number. 
There is no non-standard hardware required. We recommend a computer with the following specs:

RAM: 8+ GB  
CPU: 4+ cores, 1.8+ GHz/core

# Installation Guide
This paper only involves a MATLAB code rather than a software. The codes require the MATLAB platform (R2014a or higher version) installed on the PC or Mac computer. 
The install time of a MATLAB (R2014a) platform is commonly estimated as 30-45 minutes depending on the configurations of the computer. 

# Demo
Here are the instructions to run the code. We provide the real dataset for demo. Before implement the following demo, please open the code file using a MATLAB platform. 


# Instructions for use
## Steps to run the codes

BS_grid.m 
Mean_AA_vs_SiO2_ritt.m
Mean_AA_vs_SiO2_time.m

The reviewers or readers can use the above MATLAB codes according to the below steps. Please make sure that the dataset file ‘Earthchem_vol_P.xlsx’ is placed in the same directory with the code file. 
1. Run the BS_grid.m file. 
2. Press the F5 on the keyboard to run the program. The error bar plot will be displayed. The csv file for the calculated results will be generated simultaneously. 

## Reproduction instructions
The trends in Fig 2 and Fig. 3a in this contribution can be reproduced by running the corresponding MATLAB codes following the above steps. Further embellishment to the figure can be completed in other applications, e.g. Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, etc.
